    description: "Democritus (c. 460 – c. 370 BCE) was an ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher from Abdera, Thrace. He is best known for developing the atomic theory of the universe, proposing that all matter is composed of indivisible elements called atoms moving through the void. Often referred to as the 'Laughing Philosopher' for his emphasis on cheerfulness and a good life, Democritus wrote extensively on natural philosophy, mathematics, ethics, and cosmology, influencing later thinkers including Epicurus and, indirectly, modern science."
